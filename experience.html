				<li>Researched and analyzed the LSC output like code execution time in the simulation</li>
				<li>Increased the efficiency of the x, y, and z functions in the rotation Python file by 40%, decreased the execution time of 500000 bundles by 11%  </li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Thermal Design of iPhone SE, NY, US</h2>
			<p>
				Designed a straight-fin heat sink to help dissipate the heat and maintain the phone working temperature below 30°C with two times the thermal design power (TDP)
		Benchmarked different cooling systems, materials (thermal conductivity, density, cost, and life span), and the coolant fluid for the heat sink
		Made a simulation design drawing through CAD after obtaining the size parameters of the back of the phone
		Implemented thermal analysis to determine the heat transfer rate of the designed heat sink
		Improved the heat dissipation performance by altering the geometry and parameters of the heat sink through numerical simulation in MATLAB
		Achieved a design outcome that was approximately 7.23% higher than the maximum TDP of the iPhone SE</p>
			<h2>Design of Marine Trash Interceptor, NY, US</h2>
			<p>
				Investigated customer needs (e.g., dimensions, garbage types, costs) through questionnaires, participated in cross-functional product development meetings to establish corresponding design criteria and specifications 
			Drew CAD schematic diagrams including structure of the prototype and all parts of the conveyor system
			Conducted structural analysis to support the design by calculating the buoyancy for floating objects and the operation power for the conveyer belt
			Calculated the correlation of friction of the belt and incline angle, as well as the maximum weight that would hold in the inclined surface 
			Simulated and adjusted the design of the wind turbine by modifying the angle gradient, thickness, and surface area of the turbine blades with SiemensNX 12.0</p>
			<h2>Naval Cannon Model Manufacturing, NY, US</h2>
			<p>
				Learned practical application of different machining tools in the machine shop
			Manufactured the cannon base with the operation of horizontal and vertical milling machines, and the cannon barrel with the practice of lath techniques such as facing-off drilling and axial drilling
			Assembled each part into the whole cannon model, and operated bandsaw to polish the model</p>
