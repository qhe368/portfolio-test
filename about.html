			<p id="about-intro-text">Since I was little, I loved dismantling toys into a heap and rebuilding them. But my fascination with the STEM fields began as I joined the LEGO robotics club in my middle school after school activity. I am delighted with the process of problem-solving, a process of observing, analyzing, and testing. During the process of dealing with an integrated problem, I learned something: A complexity is never complex. No matter how intricate the problem is, it is composed of different tiny parts. As long as I organized an outline of the process, a complex problem could be broken down into several small problems. I have extensive experience in completing system-level design and collaborating with cross-functional teams, and I learned that full product development requires multidisciplinary skills which is why I am taking the web design course.</p>
